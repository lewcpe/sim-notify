SIM Notify
==========

SIM Notify is an android application for sending SMS right after the SIM was changed. It would send a message to designated number. Normally, if you send a message after the SIM_READY intent was broadcated, the SMS would cause SMS_ERROR_GENERIC_FAILURE. SIM Notify will automatically retry sending until the message was successfully sent.
